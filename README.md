## A Beginner’s Rust Notes — Now Open Source!

I started learning Rust a few months ago… and it was _hard_.  
So I made these notes **for people like me** — beginners who get stuck on ownership, lifetimes, or "why does this not compile?!"

### What’s Inside (So Far)

- "What even is ownership?" — with drawings
- Borrowing rules in plain English
- Lifetime annotations demystified (kinda)
- Cargo + simple project setup
- My failed attempts → what actually worked
- …and growing every week!

**I’m still learning** — this is my live study journal.  
If you're confused too, maybe we can figure it out together.

**Star if it helps. Fork if you improve it. Comment if you're stuck!**  
PRs from fellow beginners especially welcome 🙌
